# iGEM_Wageningen_UR_2016
As part of the iGEM (www.igem.org) competition, I created a dynamic model of the optogenetic switches pDusk and pDawn (described by Ohlendorf et al. 2012) and extended it's functionality towards an optogenetic kill switch module by implementing the mazEF toxin-antitoxin system.
